<h2 id="cran-task-view-optimization-and-mathematical-programming">CRAN Task View: Optimization and Mathematical Programming</h2>
<p>This CRAN Task View contains a list of packages which offer facilities for solving optimization problems. Although every regression model in statistics solves an optimization problem, they are not part of this view. If you are looking for regression methods, the following views will contain useful starting points: <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Multivariate">Multivariate</a>, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=SocialSciences">SocialSciences</a>, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Robust">Robust</a></p>
<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Optimization Infrastructure Packages</li>
<li>General Purpose Continuous Solvers</li>
<li>Mathematical Programming Solvers</li>
<li>Combinatorial Optimization</li>
<li>Multi Objective Optimization</li>
<li>Specific Applications in Optimization</li>
<li>References and Bibliography</li>
</ul>
<p>Packages are categorized according to these sections. See also the “Related Links” and “Other Resources” sections at the end.</p>
<p>Many packages provide functionality for more than one type of optimization problem. E.g., mixed integer linear programming solvers typically offer standard linear programming routines like the simplex algorithm for linear programming. Convex solvers will handle linear, quadratic, or cone problems extremely well, etc.</p>

<h3 id="optimization-infrastructure-packages">Optimization Infrastructure Packages</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=optimx">optimx</a> package provides a replacement and extension of the <code>optim()</code> function in Base R with a call to several function minimization codes in R in a single statement. These methods handle smooth, possibly box constrained functions of several or many parameters. Function <code>optimr()</code> in this package extends the <code>optim()</code> function with the same syntax but more ‘method’ choices. Function <code>opm()</code> applies several solvers to a selected optimization task and returns a dataframe of results for easy comparison.</p></li>
<li><p>The R Optimization Infrastructure (<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ROI">ROI</a>) package provides a framework for handling optimization problems in R. It uses an object-oriented approach to define and solve various optimization tasks from different problem classes (e.g., linear, quadratic, non-linear programming problems). This makes optimization transparent for the user as the corresponding workflow is abstracted from the underlying solver. The approach allows for easy switching between solvers and thus enhances comparability. For more information see the <a href="http://roi.r-forge.r-project.org/">ROI home page</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The package <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CVXR">CVXR</a> provides an object-oriented modeling language for Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP). It allows the user to formulate convex optimization problems in a natural way following mathematical convention and DCP rules. The system analyzes the problem, verifies its convexity, converts it into a canonical form, and hands it off to an appropriate solver such as ECOS or SCS to obtain the solution.For more information see the <a href="https://cvxr.rbind.io/">CVXR home page</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="general-purpose-continuous-solvers">General Purpose Continuous Solvers</h3>
<p>Package stats offers several general purpose optimization routines. For one-dimensional unconstrained function optimization there is <code>optimize()</code> which searches an interval for a minimum or maximum. Function <code>optim()</code> provides an implementation of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method, bounded BFGS, conjugate gradient (CG), Nelder-Mead, and simulated annealing (SANN) optimization methods. It utilizes gradients, if provided, for faster convergence. Typically it is used for unconstrained optimization, but includes an option for box-constrained optimization.</p>
<p>Additionally, for minimizing a function subject to linear inequality constraints, stats contains the routine <code>constrOptim()</code>. Then there is <code>nlm</code> which is used for solving nonlinear unconstrained minimization problems. <code>nlminb()</code> offers box-constrained optimization using the PORT routines.</p>
