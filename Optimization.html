        This CRAN task view contains a list of packages which offer
  facilities for solving optimization problems.
  Although every regression model in statistics solves an optimization
  problem they are not part of this view. If you are looking for regression
  methods, the following views will contain useful starting points:
<a href="Multivariate.html">Multivariate</a>,
<a href="SocialSciences.html">SocialSciences</a>,
<a href="Robust.html">Robust</a>
        among others. The focus of this task view is on

        </a>. Packages are categorized in these
  four sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many packages provide functionality for more than one
  of the subjects listed at the end of this task view. E.g., mixed
  integer linear programming solvers typically offer standard linear 
  programming routines like the simplex algorithm. Therefore following each 
  package description a list of abbreviations describes the typical features
  of the optimizer (i.e., the problems which can be solved). The
  full names of the abbreviations given in square brackets can be
  found at the end of this task view under
        <a href="#ClassificationBySubject">

  Subject

        Trying to unify optimization algorithms via a single wrapper
    function,
<a href="../packages/optimx/index.html">optimx</a>
        helps to proper specify the
    (nonlinear) optimization problem including objective function,
    gradient function, and scaling. This package supports the
    (local) optimization of smooth, nonlinear functions with at most
    box constraints (bounds).
<a href="../packages/optimx/index.html">optimx</a>
        depends not only on
    packages and/or functions mentioned in this section of this task
    view but also on two packages implemented by the author(s),
    namely
<a href="../packages/Rcgmin/index.html">Rcgmin</a>
        and
<a href="../packages/Rvmmin/index.html">Rvmmin</a>. Both are &quot;pure
    R&quot; implementations of conjugate gradient minimization and
    variable metric nonlinear function minimization algorithms,
    respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        The R Optimization Infrastructure (<a href="../packages/ROI/index.html">ROI</a>) package
    provides a framework for handling optimization problems in R. It
    uses an object oriented approach to define and solve various
    optimization tasks in R which can be from different problem
    classes (e.g., linear, quadratic, non-linear programming
    problems). This makes optimization transparent for the R user as
    the corresponding workflow is completely abstracted from the
    underlying solver. Furthermore, this approach allows for easy
    switching between solvers, given that corresponding solver plugins
    are available, and thus enhances comparability.

        Package stats offers several general purpose optimization routines.
    For one-dimensional unconstrained function optimization there is
<tt>optimize()</tt>
